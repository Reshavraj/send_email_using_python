# send_email_using_python

Hey Folks.!!
Before start coding.. i want recommennd you to read about libraries, modules that i have imported from Python.org documentation for better understanding.

In case you are sending emails through GMAIL, just go to your account(gmail) -> Account Setting -> scroll to the bottom of the page and you see Less Secured Apps Tab,
now you just to turn that feature ON.

I recommend turning that feature back OFF once done experimenting with email.


Happy Coding.!!
